We're thrilled to announce the official launch of the **React Foundation** — a community-driven initiative dedicated to sustaining and advancing the React ecosystem for generations to come.

## Our Mission

The React Foundation exists to ensure the React ecosystem thrives through:

- **Funding maintainers** of critical React libraries
- **Supporting education** and learning resources
- **Ensuring accessibility** for developers worldwide
- **Transparent governance** and community-driven decision making

## Why Now?

React has grown from a tool built at Meta into a global movement that powers millions of applications. The ecosystem includes 54+ essential libraries maintained by hundreds of contributors across dozens of organizations.

This growth is incredible — but it also creates sustainability challenges. Many maintainers work on these critical projects in their spare time, without compensation.

The React Foundation changes that.

## How It Works

100% of profits from our official merchandise store go directly to ecosystem maintainers. We track contributions across all 54 supported libraries using transparent, metrics-based distribution.

## Founding Members

We're grateful to our founding members who believe in this mission:

- Meta
- Microsoft
- Amazon
- Vercel
- Expo
- Callstack
- Software Mansion

Together, we're building a sustainable future for React.

## Get Involved

Whether you're a contributor, maintainer, or React enthusiast, there are many ways to support:

1. **Shop the store** - Every purchase funds maintainers
2. **Contribute to libraries** - Build the ecosystem
3. **Spread the word** - Share our mission
4. **Become a member** - Join our governance
