We're thrilled to announce the official launch of the **React Foundation** — a community-driven initiative dedicated to sustaining and advancing the React ecosystem for generations to come.

## Why We're Here

React has become something bigger than any single company should be responsible for maintaining. Over the past decade — really, the past six years or so — React has become an indispensable part of how the web is built and runs, how Chrome works, and how mobile apps are built. It powers millions of applications across the globe.

My north star has always been to **change the economic trajectory of people's lives by helping them bring their ideas to life**. React has been transformative in that way, but we still have a long way to go.

## Four Years in the Making

This didn't happen overnight. My colleagues at Meta — Matt Carroll, Joe Savona, Eli White, Sophie Alpert, Rick Hanlon and I — spent four years laying the groundwork and preparing React to leave its Meta nest. Meta is laser-focused on AI internally now, but React remains crucial there. In fact, most, if not all, of the tools built at Meta for AI work are built with React.

The React Foundation isn't about Meta abandoning React. They've contributed the most to spinning up the foundation and have committed for over five years. But it's about involving all the other companies and communities in a way that's much more compatible with keeping React healthy for the long term.

## What We're Building

The React Foundation exists to ensure the React ecosystem thrives through:

- **Funding maintainers** of critical React libraries
- **Investing in community hubs** around the world, especially in underserved areas
- **Fixing React education** — from bootcamps to local meetups
- **Supporting conferences** that align with our values and code of conduct
- **Making React more accessible** to more people worldwide

## The Bootcamp Problem

Here's something that keeps me up at night: We have lots of boot camps out there that are doing their best, but they're also sending people out into the world misinformed about how React works. React is very hard to teach, so let's fix that part of React so that it's actually not so hard to teach.

That's why one of our first priorities is to help bootcamps — not just with scholarships, but by improving how React itself is taught.

## Community Investment

I want to put gas in the tank of smaller communities to help them flourish. That means:

- Helping local developer meetups have food, drinks and great speakers
- Bringing in React core team members to teach and align communities
- Supporting amazing community-led conferences (like React Native London, which grew from a meetup!)
- Investing in React hubs around the world, especially in underserved areas

## How It Works

Here's something that's been really funny — one of the top requests since people found out about the React Foundation is, "When is the merch store launching?" People around the world want React jackets, React hoodies, React everything.

Well, it's coming. And here's the thing: **100% of profits from our official merchandise store go directly to ecosystem maintainers**. We track contributions across all 54 supported libraries using transparent, metrics-based distribution.

The foundation has three funding sources:
1. Corporate sponsorships from our founding members
2. Merchandise store profits (all going to maintainers)
3. React Conf (now able to operate more freely outside of Meta)

## Governance

The business governance is being ratified now with our founding corporate partners:

- **Meta** (committed for 5+ years, supermajority on governance for first 2.5 years)
- **Amazon**
- **Microsoft**
- **Vercel**
- **Expo**
- **Callstack**
- **Software Mansion**

The technical governance will continue much as it has been — with RFCs, public proposals, and stages before reaching canary. We have people on the slate for technical governance roles, and I'm excited about that (names coming soon).

## My Goals

Out of the gate, here's what I'm focused on:

1. **Invest in community hubs** worldwide, especially underserved areas
2. **Fix React education** in bootcamps and learning resources
3. **Support local meetups** and help them grow
4. **Align conferences** with our code of conduct and values
5. **Expand React Conf** with new capabilities now that we're independent
6. **Welcome everyone back** — there's been a lot we've done that's alienated parts of the community. I want to do everything we can to make sure everybody feels as welcome and heard and a part of the React community as they should.

## Get Involved

Whether you're a contributor, maintainer, or React enthusiast, there are many ways to support:

1. **Shop the store** - Every purchase funds maintainers
2. **Contribute to libraries** - Build the ecosystem
3. **Join a local meetup** - Build community where you are
4. **Spread the word** - Share our mission
5. **Become a member** - Join our governance
