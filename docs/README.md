## üîç Looking for Something Else?

### Public Documentation
For external/public-facing documentation (used by chatbot):
- See **[public-context/](../public-context/)** directory
- These docs are ingested into the chatbot's knowledge base
- Focused on explaining the Foundation to users, not developers

### Code Documentation
For documentation that lives with the code:
- **[src/lib/ris/README.md](../src/lib/ris/README.md)** - RIS system implementation
- **[src/lib/cis/README.md](../src/lib/cis/README.md)** - CIS system implementation

### Main Project README
For project overview and quick start:
- See **[README.md](../README.md)** at project root

## üìù Documentation Standards

When creating or updating documentation:

1. **Use Clear Headers** - Make it easy to scan
2. **Include Examples** - Show, don't just tell
3. **Link Liberally** - Cross-reference related docs
4. **Keep It Updated** - Update docs when code changes
5. **Markdown Format** - Use GitHub-flavored markdown
6. **Code Blocks** - Use proper syntax highlighting

### File Naming Convention
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `my-doc-name.md`
- Be descriptive: `ris-setup.md` not `setup.md`
- Avoid acronyms in filenames when possible

## üóÇÔ∏è Archive

Old or outdated documentation is preserved in **[../archive/](../archive/)** for historical reference.
