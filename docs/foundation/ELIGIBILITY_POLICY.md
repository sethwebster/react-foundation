# üß≠ Eligibility for React Impact Score (RIS) Funding

The React Foundation exists to strengthen the React ecosystem in the places that need it most ‚Äî ensuring that open source libraries, tools, and maintainers who make React possible have the support to continue their work.

## Guiding Principle

**RIS funding is designed to help sustain independent, community-maintained, and under-resourced projects** that are critical to the health and innovation of the React ecosystem.

**It is not intended to subsidize projects that already benefit from significant, ongoing corporate investment.**

## Eligibility Overview

The React Foundation exists to strengthen the React ecosystem in the places that need it most ‚Äî ensuring that open source libraries, tools, and maintainers who make React possible have the support to continue their work.

| Category | Description | Funding Eligibility |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Community-maintained libraries** | Independent maintainers or small teams sustaining libraries widely used in the React ecosystem. | ‚úÖ **Fully eligible** |
| **Collaborative or partially-sponsored projects** | Independent projects with limited or non-exclusive corporate support (e.g. shared maintainership, open governance). | üü° **Eligible with adjusted weighting** |
| **Corporate-maintained frameworks or products** | Projects primarily funded and maintained by large commercial entities with substantial engineering resources. Examples include Next.js (Vercel), Remix (Shopify), and Expo (Expo.dev). | ‚ùå **Ineligible for direct grants** |

---

## Why Certain Libraries Are Ineligible

To keep RIS funding equitable and impactful, we focus our resources on projects that **depend on community support to remain viable**.

Corporate-backed frameworks already benefit from:
- Dedicated full-time engineering teams
- Marketing budgets and promotional resources
- Internal funding that ensures long-term sustainability
- Enterprise support contracts and consulting revenue

### This approach allows the Foundation to:

- **Strengthen the open source commons** around React
- **Support independent innovation** that might not otherwise have resources
- **Ensure that funding decisions reflect genuine need** and ecosystem impact

---

## Strategic Collaboration Program

Corporate-maintained projects remain **essential partners** in the React ecosystem.

While they are not eligible for direct RIS-based grants, they may participate through the **Strategic Collaboration Program**, which focuses on:

- **Ecosystem alignment and standards** ‚Äî Coordinating on best practices and interoperability
- **Interoperability initiatives** ‚Äî Ensuring libraries work well together
- **Shared infrastructure and community events** ‚Äî Conferences, documentation, and tooling

This ensures continued collaboration without diverting limited grant resources away from independent maintainers.

---

## Transparency and Review

**Eligibility decisions are reviewed annually** as part of the Foundation's open governance process.

If your project's structure or sponsorship model changes, you may **request a reevaluation** of your eligibility status by contacting the Foundation.

### How to Request Reevaluation

1. **Email the Foundation** at [eligibility@react.foundation](mailto:eligibility@react.foundation) (when available)
2. **Provide updated information** about your project's governance, funding, and maintainership structure
3. **The Foundation will review** your request within 30 days
4. **Decisions and rationale** will be shared transparently

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Fully Eligible Projects

- **React Hook Form** ‚Äî Maintained by small independent team
- **Zustand** ‚Äî Community-maintained state management library
- **React Spring** ‚Äî Independent animation library with volunteer maintainers
- **React Query / TanStack Query** ‚Äî Independent with optional sponsorship but no exclusive corporate control

### üü° Eligible with Adjusted Weighting

- **React Router** ‚Äî Partially sponsored by Remix/Shopify but maintains independent governance
- **Formik** ‚Äî Has corporate sponsors but no exclusive control
- Projects with **GitHub Sponsors** or **Open Collective** funding but no dedicated engineering team

### ‚ùå Ineligible for Direct Grants

- **Next.js** ‚Äî Maintained by Vercel with full-time dedicated engineering team
- **Remix** ‚Äî Maintained by Shopify with full-time dedicated engineering team
- **Expo** ‚Äî Maintained by Expo.dev with full-time dedicated engineering team
- **Gatsby** ‚Äî Maintained by Netlify with full-time dedicated engineering team

Note: These projects are incredibly valuable to the ecosystem and remain welcome participants in the Strategic Collaboration Program.

## Adjusted Weighting for Partially-Sponsored Projects

For projects in the üü° **"Eligible with adjusted weighting"** category, we apply a sponsorship adjustment factor to ensure fair distribution:

### Weighting Calculation

```typescript
// Sponsorship level determines adjustment
const sponsorshipAdjustment = {
  none: 1.0,           // No corporate sponsorship
  minimal: 0.9,        // <$50k/year or volunteer-only
  moderate: 0.7,       // $50k-$200k/year or part-time support
  substantial: 0.4,    // $200k-$500k/year or 1-2 FTE
  exclusive: 0.0,      // $500k+/year or 3+ dedicated FTE (ineligible)
};

adjustedScore = rawRISScore * sponsorshipAdjustment;
```

This ensures that:
- Projects with **no sponsorship** receive **full funding** based on impact
- Projects with **some support** receive **proportional funding** that complements (not replaces) existing resources
- Projects with **exclusive corporate backing** are **ineligible** for direct grants

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if my project receives a one-time corporate donation?

**A:** One-time donations or grants do not affect eligibility. We look at **ongoing, structural support** (dedicated engineering time, sustained funding commitments).

### Q: What if our maintainers are employed by a company but work on the project in their spare time?

**A:** This is fine! Many open source maintainers have day jobs. Eligibility is based on whether the **project itself** receives dedicated corporate engineering resources, not individual employment status.

### Q: What if we have a corporate sponsor but they don't control the project?

**A:** This is the **üü° partially-sponsored category**. You're eligible with adjusted weighting based on the level of support. Open governance and independence matter.

### Q: Can corporate projects become eligible if they change their structure?

**A:** Yes! If a corporate-backed project transitions to **independent governance** and **community maintenance**, it can become eligible. Contact us to request a reevaluation.

### Q: How do you verify corporate relationships?

**A:** We review:
- Public GitHub organization affiliations
- Company websites and blog posts
- Job postings and team pages
- Financial disclosures (Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors)
- Direct communication with maintainers when unclear

We prioritize **transparency** and will always discuss findings with maintainers before making final decisions.
