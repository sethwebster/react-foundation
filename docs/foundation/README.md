## Foundation vs Store

The React Foundation Store is actually two integrated systems:

### Foundation Site (`/`, `/about`, `/impact`)
- Mission and values
- Impact reporting
- Contributor recognition
- Educational content
- Community resources

### Store (`/store`)
- Merchandise shop
- Time-limited drops
- Contributor perks
- Revenue generation for Foundation

Both share:
- Design system (RFDS)
- Authentication (GitHub OAuth)
- Data infrastructure
- Navigation and layout
