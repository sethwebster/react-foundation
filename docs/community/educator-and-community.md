# Educator & Community Systems - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've built **two complete impact scoring systems** plus **community discovery features** to expand the React Foundation's mission beyond code contributors.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Content Impact Score (CIS) System
**Location:** `src/lib/cis/`

**Purpose:** Measure and reward React educators, content creators, YouTubers, and course creators.

**Files Created:**
- `types.ts` - Complete TypeScript definitions (350+ lines)
- `normalization.ts` - Statistical normalization utilities
- `scoring-service.ts` - CIS calculation engine (450+ lines)
- `hooks.ts` - React hooks for UI integration (300+ lines)
- `mock-data.ts` - 6 example educators (Kent C. Dodds, Web Dev Simplified, etc.)
- `index.ts` - Public API exports
- `README.md` - Complete documentation

**5 Scoring Components:**
1. **Educational Reach (25%)** - Views, learners, enrollments, geography
2. **Content Quality & Correctness (30%)** - Peer reviews, code quality, accuracy
3. **Learning Outcomes (25%)** - Completion rates, student success, OSS contributions
4. **Community Teaching Impact (15%)** - Free content, accessibility, mentorship
5. **Consistency & Longevity (5%)** - Publishing frequency, content freshness, years active

**Tier System:**
- Platinum (Top 5%): 40% of pool
- Gold (Top 15%): 35% of pool
- Silver (Top 30%): 20% of pool
- Bronze (Top 50%): 5% of pool

### 2. Community Impact Score (CoIS) System
**Location:** `src/lib/cois/`

**Purpose:** Measure and reward React meetup organizers, conference organizers, and community builders.

**Files Created:**
- `types.ts` - Complete TypeScript definitions (300+ lines)
- `normalization.ts` - Statistical utilities + community-specific helpers
- `scoring-service.ts` - CoIS calculation engine (400+ lines)
- `hooks.ts` - React hooks for UI integration
- `mock-data.ts` - 5 example communities (React Native London, React Conf, etc.)
- `index.ts` - Public API exports

**5 Scoring Components:**
1. **Event Reach & Frequency (25%)** - Attendees, events held, event size
2. **Community Health (25%)** - Repeat attendance, diversity, CoC, satisfaction
3. **Content Quality (20%)** - Speaker quality, talk ratings, resources shared
4. **Ecosystem Growth (20%)** - OSS contributions, job placements, collaborations
5. **Sustainability (10%)** - Years active, organizer health, succession planning

**Same tier system as CIS** with percentile-based distribution.

### 3. Community Finder with Interactive Map
**Location:** `src/app/communities/`

**Purpose:** Help people discover React communities near them, increase community visibility.

**Files Created:**
- `page.tsx` - Main community finder page with hero, stats, map, list

- Post-event survey template
- Sponsor prospectus template
- Event format ideas (meetups, workshops, hackathons, conferences)

### 5. Configurable Revenue Pool System
**Location:** `src/lib/impact-pool-config.ts`

**Purpose:** Make pool splits adjustable (as you requested).

**Features:**
- Configurable RIS/CIS/CoIS percentages
- Validation (must sum to 1.0)
- Helper function to adjust CIS/CoIS split while keeping RIS constant
- Preset configurations (equal, educator-focused, organizer-focused)
- Minimum threshold protection ($10k minimum pool)
- Complete TypeScript types

**Default Configuration:**
- 60% RIS (library maintainers)
- 24% CIS (educators - 60% of non-RIS pool)
- 16% CoIS (community organizers - 40% of non-RIS pool)
- 20% of total store profits allocated to impact pools

### 6. Comprehensive Documentation
**Location:** `docs/`

**Files Created:**
- `IMPACT_SCORING_SYSTEMS.md` - Master overview of all three systems
- `community/COMMUNITY_BUILDING_TOOLKIT.md` - Complete organizer guide
- `EDUCATOR_AND_COMMUNITY_SYSTEMS.md` - This file (implementation summary)

## System Architecture

All three systems share the same proven architecture pattern:

```
src/lib/
├── ris/     # React Impact Score (existing)
├── cis/     # Content Impact Score (NEW)
└── cois/    # Community Impact Score (NEW)
```

Each system has:
- `types.ts` - TypeScript definitions
- `normalization.ts` - Statistical utilities
- `scoring-service.ts` - Calculation engine
- `hooks.ts` - React hooks
- `mock-data.ts` - Test data
- `index.ts` - Public API
- `README.md` - Documentation

## Key Features

### Invite-Only Launch (As You Requested)
- `invite_only` field on Educator and Community types
- Easy to gate access during beta/launch phase
- Content review board + metrics (shares, upvotes) for quality control

### Quality Safeguards
- **Winsorization**: Reduces outlier impact (95th percentile caps)
- **Peer Review Component**: Prevents pure metric gaming
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Excellence required across multiple dimensions
- **EMA Smoothing**: Prevents dramatic quarter-to-quarter swings
- **Content Review Board**: Manual quality verification for educators

## Usage Examples

### Calculate Educator Scores

```typescript
import { CISScoringService, MOCK_EDUCATORS } from '@/lib/cis';

const service = new CISScoringService();
const allocation = service.generateQuarterlyAllocation(
  MOCK_EDUCATORS,
  100_000, // $100k CIS pool
  '2025-Q1'
);

// Results
allocation.educators.forEach(educator => {
  console.log(`${educator.name}`);
  console.log(`  Tier: ${educator.tier}`);
  console.log(`  CIS Score: ${educator.cis.toFixed(3)}`);
  console.log(`  Allocation: $${educator.allocation_usd.toFixed(2)}`);
});
```

### Calculate Community Organizer Scores

```typescript
import { CoISScoringService, MOCK_ORGANIZERS } from '@/lib/cois';

const service = new CoISScoringService();
const allocation = service.generateQuarterlyAllocation(
  MOCK_ORGANIZERS,
  50_000, // $50k CoIS pool
  '2025-Q1'
);
```

### Adjust Pool Split

```typescript
import { adjustEducatorOrganizerSplit, calculatePoolAllocations } from '@/lib/impact-pool-config';

// Change to 75% educators / 25% organizers (from default 60/40)
const config = adjustEducatorOrganizerSplit(0.75);

// Calculate allocations from $500k quarterly store revenue
const pools = calculatePoolAllocations(500_000, config);

console.log('RIS Pool:', pools.ris_pool);      // $60k (60% of 20% of $500k)
console.log('CIS Pool:', pools.cis_pool);      // $30k (75% of non-RIS)
console.log('CoIS Pool:', pools.cois_pool);    // $10k (25% of non-RIS)
```

### Use React Hooks in UI

```typescript
'use client';

import { useCISScores, useCoISScores, useEducatorTier } from '@/lib/cis';
import { MOCK_EDUCATORS } from '@/lib/cis/mock-data';
import { MOCK_ORGANIZERS } from '@/lib/cois/mock-data';

function ImpactLeaderboard() {
  const educatorScores = useCISScores(MOCK_EDUCATORS);
  const organizerScores = useCoISScores(MOCK_ORGANIZERS);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Top Educators</h2>
      {educatorScores.slice(0, 10).map(educator => {
        const tier = useEducatorTier(educator.tier);
        return (
          <div key={educator.educatorId}>
            <span className={tier.color}>{tier.icon}</span>
            {educator.name}: {educator.cis.toFixed(3)}
          </div>
        );
      })}

      <h2>Top Communities</h2>
      {organizerScores.slice(0, 10).map(org => (
        <div key={org.organizerId}>
          {org.name}: {org.cois.toFixed(3)}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
