## Getting Started

### Starting Your First React Meetup

**Step 1: Define Your Mission**
- What gap are you filling in your local React community?
- Who is your target audience? (Beginners, professionals, all levels)
- What makes your community unique?

**Step 2: Find Co-Organizers**
- Don't do it alone - find 2-3 co-organizers
- Look for complementary skills (logistics, technical, marketing)
- Ensure diversity in your organizing team

**Step 3: Choose Your Platform**
- **Meetup.com**: Best for local discoverability ($15-30/mo)
- **Eventbrite**: Good for larger free events
- **Luma**: Modern, free alternative with RSVP management

**Step 4: Secure Initial Venue**
- Ask local companies with React teams
- Universities often have free event spaces
- Co-working spaces (WeWork, etc.)
- Start with capacity for 30-50 people

**Step 5: Launch Event**
- Schedule 6-8 weeks out
- Create compelling event description
- Share on Twitter, LinkedIn, local dev groups
