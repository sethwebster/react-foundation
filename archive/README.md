# Documentation Archive

This directory contains outdated or superseded documentation files. These files are preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Why Archive Documentation?

Rather than deleting old documentation, we archive it to:
1. Preserve project history
2. Reference past decisions and approaches
3. Help understand how the project evolved
4. Avoid losing valuable context

## What's Archived Here

## Using Archived Documentation

⚠️ **Warning**: Documentation in this directory may be:
- Out of date
- No longer relevant
- Superseded by newer docs
- Incomplete or inaccurate

Always check the current documentation in **[docs/](../docs/)** first.

## When to Archive

Archive documentation when:
- ✅ It's superseded by newer documentation
- ✅ It describes features/approaches no longer used
- ✅ It's a temporary status/session note
- ✅ It's a duplicate that's been consolidated

Don't archive documentation if:
- ❌ It's still relevant and current
- ❌ It documents currently used features
- ❌ It would leave a gap in documentation
- ❌ It's referenced by active code

## Cleaning Up the Archive

The archive can be cleaned up periodically:
- Remove files >1 year old that have no historical value
- Consolidate similar archived docs
- Add this README with context about what was removed
