## Public Context Notes

Place any LLM-facing documentation here that should be available as chatbot context but is not rendered as part of the main site. Files in this directory are indexed alongside live site pages during `npm run chatbot:index`, so keep the content concise, source-attributed, and free of secrets. Use markdown or plain text.
