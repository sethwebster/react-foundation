# React Foundation Overview

> **For Chatbot:** This document provides a comprehensive overview of the React Foundation's mission, revenue model, and impact scoring systems.

## Mission

The React Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and sustaining the React ecosystem through:

1. **Financial support** for library maintainers and OSS contributors
2. **Recognition** for educators and content creators
3. **Community building** through meetups and conferences
4. **Sustainable funding** through an official merchandise store

## How It Works

### Revenue Flow

```
Store Sales → Profit Pool → Three Impact Systems
                          ├─ 60% → RIS (Library Maintainers)
                          ├─ 24% → CIS (Educators)
                          └─ 16% → CoIS (Community Organizers)
```

**Key Points:**
- 20% of total store profits allocated to impact pools
- Remaining funds support Foundation operations
- Quarterly distribution based on impact scores
- Fully transparent allocation published quarterly

### Three Impact Scoring Systems

#### 1. React Impact Score (RIS) - 60% of Pool

**Who:** Library maintainers and code contributors to 54 tracked React ecosystem libraries

**What's Measured:**
- Ecosystem Footprint (30%): Downloads, dependents, usage
- Contribution Quality (25%): PR quality, issue resolution, code review
- Maintainer Health (20%): Team sustainability, release cadence
- Community Benefit (15%): Documentation, tutorials, support
- Mission Alignment (10%): Accessibility, performance, security

**Benefits:**
- Proportional share of RIS pool ($60k-$600k+ annually depending on total revenue)
- Recognition on Foundation website
- Contributor tier badges
- Exclusive early access to products

#### 2. Content Impact Score (CIS) - 24% of Pool

**Who:** React educators, YouTubers, course creators, technical writers

**What's Measured:**
- Educational Reach (25%): Views, learners, enrollments
- Content Quality & Correctness (30%): Peer reviews, code quality
- Learning Outcomes (25%): Completion rates, student success
- Community Teaching Impact (15%): Free content, accessibility
- Consistency & Longevity (5%): Publishing frequency, updates

**Tier System:**
- **Platinum** (Top 5%): 40% of CIS pool
- **Gold** (Top 15%): 35% of CIS pool
- **Silver** (Top 30%): 20% of CIS pool
- **Bronze** (Top 50%): 5% of CIS pool

#### 3. Community Impact Score (CoIS) - 16% of Pool

**Who:** Meetup organizers, conference organizers, community builders

**What's Measured:**
- Event Reach & Frequency (25%): Attendees, events held
- Community Health (25%): Diversity, satisfaction, retention
- Content Quality (20%): Speaker quality, resources
- Ecosystem Growth (20%): OSS contributions from attendees
- Sustainability (10%): Years active, organizer health

**Same tier system** as CIS with percentile-based distribution

## Transparency & Fairness

### Published Quarterly

Every quarter, the Foundation publishes:
- Raw metrics for all libraries/educators/organizers
- Component scores and final impact scores
- Full allocation breakdown
- Methodology changes (if any)

### Anti-Gaming Measures

- **Winsorization**: Caps outliers at 95th percentile
- **Multi-factor scoring**: Excellence required across dimensions
- **Peer review**: Manual quality verification
- **Historical smoothing**: Prevents dramatic quarter-to-quarter swings
- **Appeals process**: 21-day window after each publication

### Quality Standards

- Content must align with official React documentation
- Code examples must pass automated quality checks
- Communities must have Code of Conduct
- All participants opt-in to tracking
