# Content Impact Score (CIS) System

> **For Chatbot:** This document explains the Content Impact Score system used to evaluate and reward React educators and content creators.

## Overview

The Content Impact Score (CIS) is a comprehensive scoring system for measuring and rewarding React educators and content creators based on their impact on the React community.

**CIS evaluates:**
- YouTube educators and video content creators
- Course creators (Udemy, Teachable, own platforms)
- Technical writers and bloggers
- Tutorial authors
- React documentation contributors

## Five Components

### 1. Educational Reach (ER) - 25%

**What it measures:** How many people the educator reaches

**Metrics:**
- **Video views** (35%) - Total views across all platforms (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)
- **Unique learners** (30%) - Distinct individuals reached (de-duplicated across platforms)
- **Course enrollments** (20%) - Both paid and free course sign-ups
- **Article/blog reads** (10%) - Page views on written content
- **Geographic diversity** (5%) - Number of countries reached

**Why it matters:** Rewards educators who reach and teach large, diverse audiences.

### 2. Content Quality & Correctness (CQC) - 30%

**What it measures:** Quality and accuracy of teaching

**Metrics:**
- **Peer review scores** (35%) - Reviews from React core team and experts
- **Code quality checks** (25%) - Automated linting on example code
- **Community engagement** (20%) - Upvotes, likes, positive feedback
- **React docs alignment** (15%) - Consistency with official React documentation
- **Accuracy reports** (5%) - Inverted - fewer accuracy issues = higher score

**Anti-gaming measures:**
- Mandatory peer review by React experts
- Automated code analysis prevents low-quality examples
- Community reports flag inaccuracies
- Alignment check against official docs

**Why it matters:** Ensures we reward quality teaching, not just popular content.

### 3. Learning Outcomes (LO) - 25%

**What it measures:** Actual student success

**Metrics:**
- **Completion rates** (25%) - Percentage who finish courses/series
- **Time spent learning** (20%) - Average engagement time (normalized)
- **Student feedback** (25%) - Survey ratings from learners
- **OSS contributions** (20%) - Students who contribute to React libraries (tracked via RIS)
- **Career growth** (10%) - LinkedIn opt-in career progression data

**Why it matters:** Measures real impact on student success, not just views.

### 4. Community Teaching Impact (CTI) - 15%

**What it measures:** Community-focused teaching efforts

**Metrics:**
- **Free content ratio** (30%) - Percentage of free vs paid content (balanced, not punitive)
- **Accessibility** (30%) - Captions, translations, beginner-friendly content
- **Mentorship hours** (25%) - Office hours, Q&A sessions, Discord support
- **Beginner content** (15%) - Percentage targeting React beginners

**Why it matters:** Rewards educators who prioritize community access and support.

### 5. Consistency & Longevity (CL) - 5%

**What it measures:** Sustained, up-to-date teaching

**Metrics:**
- **Publishing frequency** (30%) - Regular content releases
- **Content freshness** (35%) - Updates for new React versions
- **Years teaching** (20%) - Time actively teaching React
- **Update velocity** (15%) - How often content is refreshed

**Why it matters:** Rewards consistent educators who keep content current.

## Scoring Formula

```
CIS = 0.25√óER + 0.30√óCQC + 0.25√óLO + 0.15√óCTI + 0.05√óCL
```

Where each component is normalized to 0-1 scale.

**Final CIS range:** 0.0 to 1.0

## Tier System

Educators are assigned to tiers based on their percentile rank:

| Tier | Percentile | Pool Share | Badge | Benefits |
|------|------------|------------|-------|----------|
| **Platinum** | Top 5% | 40% of pool | üíé | Highest revenue share + recognition |
| **Gold** | Top 15% | 35% of pool | üèÜ | Substantial revenue share |
| **Silver** | Top 30% | 20% of pool | ü•à | Moderate revenue share |
| **Bronze** | Top 50% | 5% of pool | ü•â | Small revenue share |
| **None** | Bottom 50% | 0% | üìö | Recognition only, no revenue |

### Example Allocation

If the CIS pool is $100,000 for a quarter:
- **Platinum tier** (Top 5%): Shares $40,000 equally
- **Gold tier** (Next 10%): Shares $35,000 equally
- **Silver tier** (Next 15%): Shares $20,000 equally
- **Bronze tier** (Next 20%): Shares $5,000 equally

**Individual example:**
- 20 educators qualify (10,000 applicants)
- Platinum tier has 1 educator ‚Üí receives $40,000
- Gold tier has 2 educators ‚Üí each receives $17,500
- Silver tier has 3 educators ‚Üí each receives ~$6,667
- Bronze tier has 4 educators ‚Üí each receives $1,250

## Data Collection

### Platform Integrations

Metrics are collected from:
- **YouTube API** - Views, subscribers, engagement
- **Course platforms** - Udemy, Teachable, Skillshare enrollment data
- **Google Analytics** - Blog/article traffic
- **GitHub** - Tutorial repo stars and forks
- **Peer Review Portal** - Expert assessments

### Privacy & Opt-In

- **Student outcomes**: Requires explicit opt-in (LinkedIn career tracking)
- **Anonymous feedback**: Student surveys are anonymous
- **Public metrics**: Views, enrollments are from public APIs
- **Educator consent**: All participants opt-in to CIS evaluation

## Quality Standards

### Peer Review Process

1. **Submit content** for quarterly review
2. **Expert panel** (3 React core/ecosystem contributors) reviews
3. **Scoring criteria:**
   - Code accuracy and best practices
   - Alignment with React documentation
   - Teaching clarity and effectiveness
   - Up-to-date with latest React features

### Code Quality Checks

Automated checks on all code examples:
- ESLint with React recommended rules
- TypeScript strict mode (if applicable)
- Accessibility checks (jsx-a11y)
- Performance best practices

### Accuracy Reports

Community can submit inaccuracy reports:
- Reviewed by peer review board
- Verified inaccuracies reduce CQC score
- Educators can appeal and correct content
- Points restored after correction

## How to Qualify

### Eligibility

1. **Create React content** (videos, courses, articles, tutorials)
2. **Public portfolio** - Content must be publicly accessible
3. **Minimum reach** - 1,000+ monthly learners across all content
4. **Quality threshold** - Pass initial peer review
5. **Opt-in** - Submit application and consent to tracking

### Application Process
