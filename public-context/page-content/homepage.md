## Building the future of React, together.

The React Foundation is a community-driven initiative dedicated to sustaining and advancing the React ecosystem by funding maintainers, supporting education, and ensuring accessibility for all developers.

## Our Mission

We exist to ensure the React ecosystem thrives for generations to come. By creating sustainable funding mechanisms and transparent governance, we empower maintainers to build the tools millions of developers rely on.

## Three Pillars of Impact

Every contribution supports our three core initiatives:

### Fund Maintainers

Direct financial support for the developers maintaining the libraries you depend on every day. Every purchase helps sustain open source.

### Education & Resources

Supporting tutorials, documentation, workshops, and learning materials that help developers master React and its ecosystem.

### Global Accessibility

Ensuring React remains accessible and inclusive for developers worldwide, regardless of location, background, or resources.

**Impact Metrics:**
- Ecosystem libraries supported

## Become a Contributor
