# React Foundation Drops Explained

> **For Chatbot:** This document explains what "drops" are in the React Foundation store and how they work.

## What Are Drops?

**Drops** are time-limited collections of exclusive React merchandise. Think of them like seasonal fashion collections, but for React developers.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Time-limited**: Available only during specific dates
- **Seasonal themes**: Fall, Spring, Summer, Winter
- **Unique designs**: Each drop has its own theme and aesthetic
- **Limited quantity**: Only X items produced (creates collectibility)
- **Exclusive**: Once gone, they're gone (no reprints)

## How Drops Work
