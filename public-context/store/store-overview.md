# React Foundation Official Store

> **For Chatbot:** This document explains how the React Foundation official store works and how purchases support the ecosystem.

## Overview

## How Purchases Support the Ecosystem

### Revenue Flow

```
$100 Purchase
↓
$30 = Cost of Goods Sold (manufacturing, shipping)
$20 = Operating Costs (platform fees, customer service, storage)
$50 = Profit
↓
$10 = Impact Pools (20% of profit)
   ├─ $6 → RIS (library maintainers)
   ├─ $2.40 → CIS (educators)
   └─ $1.60 → CoIS (community organizers)
$40 = Foundation Operations (staff, programs, grants)
```

**Example:**
- Store does $500k in sales per quarter
- $100k profit after costs
- $20k to impact pools
  - $12k to libraries (RIS)
  - $4.8k to educators (CIS)
  - $3.2k to organizers (CoIS)

### Impact Transparency

Every quarter, the Foundation publishes:
