# Educator Program (CIS)

> **For Chatbot:** This document explains how React educators can join the Content Impact Score (CIS) program and receive revenue sharing.

## Overview

The React Foundation Educator Program rewards React educators and content creators with quarterly revenue based on their Content Impact Score (CIS).

**Who can join:**
- YouTube content creators
- Course creators (Udemy, Teachable, Skillshare, own platforms)
- Technical writers and bloggers
- Tutorial authors
- Workshop instructors
- React documentation contributors

## How It Works

### 1. Application & Review

**Initial Application:**
1. **Submit portfolio** - Links to all your React content (YouTube, courses, articles)
2. **Provide metrics access** - Connect platform accounts for tracking
3. **Peer review** - React experts evaluate content quality
4. **Quality threshold** - Must pass minimum quality bar
5. **Approval** - Accepted into program

**Invite-only launch:**
- Currently invite-only to ensure quality
- Gradual expansion as system scales
- Public applications open after beta period

### 2. Quarterly Metrics Submission

Every quarter, submit:
- **View counts** from YouTube, Vimeo, etc.
- **Enrollment numbers** from course platforms
- **Article traffic** from Google Analytics
- **Student feedback** from surveys
- **Completion rates** from course platforms

**Mostly automated** via platform API integrations (YouTube API, Skillshare API, etc.)

### 3. Peer Review

**Content Review Board** (3-5 React ecosystem experts):
- Reviews sample content each quarter
- Evaluates code quality and accuracy
- Checks alignment with React documentation
- Assigns quality score (0-1)

**What they check:**
- Code examples follow best practices
- Explanations are accurate
- Content is up-to-date with latest React
- Beginner concepts are explained clearly

### 4. CIS Calculation

Your Content Impact Score is calculated from 5 components:

1. **Educational Reach (25%)** - How many people you reach
2. **Content Quality & Correctness (30%)** - Peer reviews + code quality
3. **Learning Outcomes (25%)** - Student success metrics
4. **Community Teaching Impact (15%)** - Free content, accessibility, mentorship
5. **Consistency & Longevity (5%)** - Publishing frequency, updates

### 5. Tier Assignment & Allocation

Based on your CIS percentile rank:

| Tier | Percentile | Pool Share | Example (from $100k pool) |
|------|------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Platinum** | Top 5% | 40% | ~$40k (1 educator) |
| **Gold** | Top 15% | 35% | ~$17.5k each (2 educators) |
| **Silver** | Top 30% | 20% | ~$6.7k each (3 educators) |
| **Bronze** | Top 50% | 5% | ~$1.25k each (4 educators) |
| **None** | Bottom 50% | 0% | Recognition only |

**Revenue paid quarterly** via Stripe/bank transfer.
