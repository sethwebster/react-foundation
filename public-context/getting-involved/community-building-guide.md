## Starting a React Meetup

### Quick Start (4 Steps)

**1. Find 2-3 Co-Organizers**
- Don't do it alone - prevents burnout
- Look for complementary skills (logistics, technical, marketing)
- Ensure diversity in your organizing team

**2. Pick a Platform**
- **Meetup.com**: Best for local discoverability ($15-30/mo)
- **Eventbrite**: Free for free events, good for larger gatherings
- **Luma**: Modern, free alternative
- **Discord/Slack**: For ongoing chat between events

**3. Secure a Venue**
- Ask local companies with React teams (free venues!)
- Universities often have event spaces
- Co-working spaces (WeWork, etc.)
- Coffee shops for smaller groups (10-20 people)
- Start with capacity for 30-50 people

**4. Schedule Your First Event**
- **6-8 weeks out** gives time to promote
- **Weekday evening** (Tuesday/Wednesday 6:30-8:30pm works well)
- **Compelling description** - What will people learn?
- **Promote** on Twitter, LinkedIn, local dev groups

- Remote speakers via Zoom
- Speaker swap with nearby meetups

### Challenge: Low attendance

**Solutions:**
- Promote earlier (6-8 weeks, not 1 week)

- Pick better day/time (test different slots)
- Improve talk topics (survey audience interests)

**Solutions:**
- Rotate organizing responsibilities
- Take breaks (quarterly instead of monthly)
- Find more co-organizers
- Simplify format (less ambitious events)
- CoIS funding helps cover time investment

### Challenge: Keeping people engaged

**Solutions:**
- Post-event networking time (very important!)
- Create Discord/Slack for between events
- Share resources and follow-ups
- Build traditions (lightning talks, show & tell)
- Recognize regular attendees

## Best Practices

✅ **Be consistent** - Regular schedule builds community
✅ **Welcome newcomers** - Make first-timers feel included
✅ **Follow up** - Share slides and resources after
✅ **Build tradition** - Recurring segments create identity
✅ **Celebrate wins** - Recognize community achievements

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't over-plan** - Simple events work fine
❌ **Don't go solo** - Get co-organizers from start
❌ **Don't skip CoC** - It's essential for safety
❌ **Don't chase numbers** - Quality > quantity
❌ **Don't burn out** - Take breaks when needed
❌ **Don't forget fun** - Social aspect matters!
