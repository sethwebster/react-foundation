# Temporary workaround for Next.js 16 + NextAuth v4 peer dependency conflict
#
# Next.js 16 was released on Oct 21, 2025 (very recent)
# NextAuth v4.24.11 peer deps only allow Next.js ^12.2.5 || ^13 || ^14 || ^15
# Auth.js v5 beta only allows Next.js ^14 || ^15
#
# NextAuth v4 is functionally compatible with Next.js 16 (verified by successful builds)
# but npm blocks installation due to conservative peer dependency ranges.
#
# This flag tells npm to ignore peer dependency mismatches and install anyway.
#
# Exit strategy: Remove this file when NextAuth/Auth.js adds official Next.js 16 support
# Expected: NextAuth v4.25+ or Auth.js v5 stable release
#
# Risk: Unsupported configuration, but proven to work in our codebase
# Monitor: https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/releases
